## Plan on improving the project

Enchanced Transitions: To improve the user experience, I plan to update the projects transitions and animations to help make them more visually appealing.

Dynamic Pricing feature:
I am implementing a dynamic pricing system using arrays to enable business owners to eaily update pricing to their tables. This feature will:
-Allow for quck adjustments to the meu prices through a streamlined interface
-Autmatically reflect changes across the application without requiring manual updates to multiple componets.
