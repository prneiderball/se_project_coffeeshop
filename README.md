## Plan on improving the project

Typography Enhancements
-Key words like "Aeropress" and "French press" in video captions are highlighted:
-Styled with a distinct color (#3F96F3).
-Italicized to add emphasis and improve readability.

Subtle Animations
-hover effects to video captions for an interactive touch:
-Captions slightly scale up on hover for a dynamic feel.
-Will implement a parallax effect on the background image to add depth to the design.

Interactive Elements
-Will make video captions clickable, linking directly to the corresponding YouTube video for easy access.

Layout Improvements
-Enhanced responsiveness by dynamically adjusting the spacing between videos on larger screens using media queries.
-Accessibility Features
-Will add aria-label attributes to iframe elements to ensure screen readers provide accurate descriptions of embedded videos.

Dynamic Pricing Feature
-I am implementing a dynamic pricing system using arrays to allow business owners to easily update pricing for their tables. This feature will:
Allow quick adjustments to the menu prices through a streamlined interface.
Automatically reflect changes across the application without requiring manual updates to multiple components.
